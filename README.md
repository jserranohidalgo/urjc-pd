This is the repository of the course on Functional Programming in
Scala taught at the University Rey Juan Carlos. 

# Content 

The course basically includes several notebooks on the following topics:

* PF-1.1 Object-oriented Scala
* PF-2.1 Functions and algebraic data types
* PF-2.2 Recursive functions and ADTs
* PF-2.3 The Curry-Howard correspondence
* PF-3.1 The Hall-of-Fame of HOFs
* PF-3.2 HOFs as a query language

# Launching notebooks

To access these notebooks you need first to clone this repository in your local drive: 

`> git clone https://github.com/jserranohidalgo/urjc-pd-21-22.git pd`

Then, run the program:

`jupyter notebook` 

in the root directory of the repository, if you already installed
`jupyter` in your computer (see instructions below).

Alternatively, you can skip the manual installation of `jupyter`
and run it through docker as follows:

`docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 4040:4040 -m 4g -v "$PWD":/home/jovyan/work almondsh/almond:latest` (LINUX)

`docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 4040:4040 -m 4g -v <<c:/path/to/downloaded/folder>>:/home/jovyan/work almondsh/almond:latest` (WINDOWS)

(also in the root directory of the repository)

Finally, note that `jupyter` is already installed in the virtual
environment MyApps (just for URJC users).

# Installing jupyter and the Scala kernel

To install jupyter and run Scala notebooks, follow these steps:

* Install the package manager [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), or use `pip`, the python package manager.
* Install [`jupyter`](https://jupyter.org/install) itself
* Install the Scala plugin [`almond`](https://almond.sh/docs/quick-start-install)
